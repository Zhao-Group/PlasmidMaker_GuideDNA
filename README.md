# PlasmidMaker_GuideDNA

Given any number of annotated '.DNA' file as an input, the code generates guides, primers and possible combinations of restriction enzymes for performing and verifying high-fidelity, scarless PfAgo-guided plasmid assembly. A standalone code to verify plasmids using restriction digestion enzymes is also provided. A plasmid quality check for Ago-based assembly can also be performed using the script plasmid_quality_check.ipynb.
